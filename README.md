## Executive Summary
- Traffic authorities lacked a clear understanding of crash patterns across the city over the past decade.
- An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed using over 200,000 records to track key accident KPIs, causes, timing, and severity.
- The report provides data-driven insights to support leadership decision-making.
- Findings show that “Unable to Determine” is the leading contributory cause, with the highest number of crashes recorded in 2024.
## Problem Statement
City leadership requires data-driven insights into accident trends from 2016–2025 to guide policy decisions and justify budget allocation
### Key Questions
- How have crash rates changed over time?
- What are the main causes of crashes?
- When and where do crashes occur most frequently?
## The Process (Methodology)
Tools Used: Power BI, Power Query, DAX
## Data Sourcing & Overview
The dataset contains over 200,000 traffic crash records with 24 columns covering accidents between 2016 and 2025.
## Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Removed duplicate and null records
- Created crash time and month columns
- Built a structured date table for analysis
